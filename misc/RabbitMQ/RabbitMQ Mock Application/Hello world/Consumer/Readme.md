The code uses the RabbitMQ.Client library to connect to a RabbitMQ server running on the local machine. 

1. First, it creates a new instance of the ConnectionFactory class and sets its HostName property to "localhost". This indicates that the code will connect to a RabbitMQ server running on the same machine. The ConnectionFactory class is used to create connections to a RabbitMQ server and it has several properties, such as UserName, Password, VirtualHost, etc., that can be used to configure the connection.

1. Next, it creates a connection to the server by calling the CreateConnection() method on the factory. This returns an instance of the IConnection interface, which represents a connection to the RabbitMQ server and is used to create channels.

2. Then, it creates a new channel from the connection by calling the CreateModel() method. The channel is used to interact with the message queue and is an abstraction of an AMQP 0-9-1 channel.

3. Next, it declares the "letterbox" queue using the QueueDeclare method of the channel. The queue is declared as non-durable, which means that it will not survive a broker restart or crash. It is also declared as non-exclusive and non-auto-deleting. A durable queue will survive a broker restart or crash and will be available for message consumption again when the broker comes back up.

4. Next, it creates a new instance of the EventingBasicConsumer class, passing the channel object as an argument to its constructor. The EventingBasicConsumer class provides an event-based way of consuming messages from a queue.

5. It sets the Received event to handle incoming messages. When a message is received on the channel, the Received event is fired, and the event handler is executed. This way, the program doesn't have to poll for messages on the queue, and the consumer can handle messages as they come in.

7. The event handler converts the message body from binary to string using the Encoding.UTF8.GetString method and prints the message to the console.

8. Finally, the code starts consuming messages from the queue using the BasicConsume method, which starts a basic consume loop that receives messages from the queue. The autoAck parameter is set to true, which means that messages will be acknowledged automatically as soon as they are received by the consumer. The consume loop runs until the user presses a key, at which point the code exits.
