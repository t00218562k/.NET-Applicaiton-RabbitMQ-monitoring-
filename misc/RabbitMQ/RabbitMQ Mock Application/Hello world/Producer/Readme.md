The code is using the RabbitMQ library to connect to a message queue service running on "localhost". 

1. First, it creates a new instance of the ConnectionFactory class and sets its HostName property to "localhost". This indicates that the code will connect to a RabbitMQ server running on the same machine. The ConnectionFactory class is used to create connections to a RabbitMQ server and it has several properties, such as UserName, Password, VirtualHost, etc., that can be used to configure the connection. 

2. Next, it creates a connection to the server by calling the CreateConnection() method on the factory. This returns an instance of the IConnection interface, which represents a connection to the RabbitMQ server and is used to create channels.

3. Then, it creates a new channel from the connection by calling the CreateModel() method. The channel is used to interact with the message queue and is an abstraction of an AMQP 0-9-1 channel.

4. Next, it declares the "letterbox" queue using the QueueDeclare method of the channel. The queue is declared as non-durable, which means that it will not survive a broker restart or crash. It is also declared as non-exclusive and non-auto-deleting. A durable queue will survive a broker restart or crash and will be available for message consumption again when the broker comes back up.

5. Then, it creates a variable named "message" and assigns a string "Hello World" to it. This message will be published to the queue.

6. Next, it encodes the message variable to a byte array using the Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes method and assigns it to the variable "encodedMessage". This is done because the BasicPublish method takes a byte array as a parameter, so the message needs to be encoded to a byte array before being published to the queue.

7. It then uses the BasicPublish method of the channel to publish the encoded message to the "letterbox" queue. The first parameter is the exchange name, in this case, it is an empty string, which means the default exchange. The second parameter is the routing key, in this case, it is the name of the queue, "letterbox". The third parameter is an instance of the IBasicProperties interface, which can be used to set additional properties on the message, in this case, it is set to null. The fourth parameter is the encoded message.

8. Finally, it prints the original message to the console to indicate that the message has been published using Console.WriteLine($"Publish message: {message}");
