## Docker image for a .NET application using RabbitMQ

1. Create a Dockerfile in the root of your .NET application. This file will contain the instructions to build the Docker image.
1. In the Dockerfile, specify the base image for your application. For example, if your application is built on .NET Core, you would use the official .NET Core image from Docker Hub.
1. Add any dependencies your application needs, such as RabbitMQ. You can use the official RabbitMQ image from Docker Hub.
1. Copy the application's code and any other necessary files into the image.
1. Set the working directory and any environment variables required by your application.
1. Define the command to run when the container starts, typically this is the command to start your application.
1. Build the image using the "docker build" command and specifying the path to your Dockerfile
1. Run the container using the "docker run" command, and make sure to link it to the rabbitmq container by using --link <rabbitmq container name>
1. Test your application to make sure it's running correctly inside the container.
1. Here's an example of a Dockerfile for a .NET Core application that uses RabbitMQ:

# Code
```Dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.1 AS build

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y rabbitmq-server

COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

RUN dotnet restore
RUN dotnet build

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:3.1

COPY --from=build /app .

ENV RABBITMQ_HOST=rabbitmq

CMD ["dotnet", "run"]
```
